NOTE : You must have JavaFx setup correctly to work with this. Here you can find how to do it in here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDaXpDtYk3E

I would recommend to open this with IntelliJ as I build it with the same SDK too. 

Here you will a online website of a friut market. You can buy fruit online here.
